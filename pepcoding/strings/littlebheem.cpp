/*
ittle Bheem uses his free time to paint. For this hobby, he prefers to use brushes, and a palette comprising X colours overall. His friend Raju decided to use Bheem’s talent and gave him his new colouring book for Bheem to colour. The colouring book contains N images numbered 1,2,…, N.




Bheem has decided to paint each image in exactly one colour of the possible X colours from his palette. However, he likes colourful things. He chose N numbers qi and decided to paint the image numbered i differently than the images numbered qi unless qi=i. If qi=i, that means he can paint the image numbered qi in whichever colour he likes, as long as all other conditions have been met.




Bheem wants to know the number of possible ways to colour Raju’s colouring book, and he fearfully needs your help! Calculate the number of possible ways to colour the book. Given the fact that the output can be very large, print the answer modulo 1000000007.

Input format :

The first line of input contains positive integers N, X.

The following line of input contains N numbers qi, as stated in the text.

Output format :

The output displays the number of possible ways to color Raju’s book.

Code constraints :

1 ≤ N, K ≤ 106

1 ≤ fi ≤ N

Input 1 :
2 3
2 1
Output 1 :
